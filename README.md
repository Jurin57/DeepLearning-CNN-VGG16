The raw dataset:CelebFaces dataset contains 202,599 face images of various celebrities. 
For each image, there are 40 binary attribute annotations where “1” repre- sents positive while “-1” represents negative. 
For example, if the attribute “Attractive” is annotated as “1”, the corresponding face image is considered by a group of researchers as attractive, while if the attribute value is anno- tated as “-1”, the image is considered not attractive.
